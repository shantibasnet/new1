    <p>Hi! I am Shanti Basnet.I'm from Nepal originally. I am an senior with a information technology major and a graphic design minor. This is my last semester so I am a little nervous about going into the real work life.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a person with a simple life that goes with the current right now. In my free time, I like to paint, illustrate, compose songs, edit, travel, photograph, and sleep.</p>
    
    <p> I grew up with my parents and my siblings back in my country. I have always been a calm and a motivate person nut recently everything is going downhall. I was excited for my fall intership but due to the covid-19 they decided to cancel the whole program. It was an unfortunate event but I am still lucky to survive despite of today's condition.  </p>
    <p> I am planning to work as a software developer after I graduate from here. I joined the gra phics design as I was always fasinated by it and I am glad I followed by heart because I get to learn a lot.</p>
